# Third-party notices

RIMKit contains robot model files derived from third-party repositories. These
files retain their upstream licenses; the repository-level Apache-2.0 license
does not replace those terms.

## nanobind

The compiled `rimkit._core_native` extension incorporates nanobind.

Source: https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind

License: BSD-3-Clause. A copy is provided at
licenses/nanobind-BSD-3-Clause.txt.

## MuJoCo

The native extension is compiled against and dynamically links to MuJoCo
3.6.0, which is installed as a required Python package dependency. RIMKit wheels
do not bundle a separate copy of the MuJoCo shared library.

Source: https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco

License: Apache-2.0. The installed MuJoCo distribution carries its license
notice.

## Unitree Robotics robot descriptions

Models: G1, H1, H2, and R1

Pinned source revision: ae6a8403e272733e9996ef59990880330496177f

License: BSD-3-Clause. A copy is provided at
licenses/unitree-BSD-3-Clause.txt and with the packaged Unitree assets.

RIMKit-local copies may contain retargeting landmarks and scene integration
changes. File-level provenance and hashes are recorded in the adjacent
SOURCE.yaml manifest.

## ROBOTIS K1 robot description

Model: K1

order. Exact modifications and hashes are recorded beside the assets.

## Fourier Intelligence GR3 robot description

Model: GR3

Source: https://github.com/YanjieZe/GMR

Pinned source revision: bb1bbe40774794fceb2a7c579a3464a28e68c844

License: MIT. A copy is provided at `licenses/gmr-MIT.txt` and beside the
packaged GR3 assets.

The RIMKit-local XML removes the standalone scene, adds contact-aware
retargeting landmarks, and enables the physical foot and hand mesh collisions.

## AgiBot A3 robot description

Model: A3 T3.0

Source: https://github.com/AgibotTech/A3-A3U-robot-model

Pinned source revision: 589f508ff357447c610a3f3004419035ddc8f153

License: MulanPSL-2.0. A copy is provided at
`licenses/agibot-MulanPSL-2.0.txt` and with the packaged AgiBot assets.

The RIMKit-local XML removes the standalone terrain include and adds shoulder,
sole, toe, and hand-tip retargeting landmarks.

## LimX Dynamics Oli robot description

Model: Oli (HU_D04)

Source: https://github.com/limxdynamics/humanoid-description

Pinned source revision: a90f734c153aa3ecffc8b674af1e0a323cb55d1a

License: Apache-2.0. A copy is provided at
licenses/limx-Apache-2.0.txt and with the packaged LimX assets.

The RIMKit-local XML scopes vendor defaults and uses RIMKit's shared scene. Exact
provenance, modifications, and hashes are recorded beside the packaged model.

## ENGINEAI PM01 robot description

Model: PM01

Source: https://github.com/YanjieZe/GMR

Pinned source revision: 39c70d031287d899eade658cea3d88b41402356c

License: BSD-3-Clause. A copy is provided at
licenses/engineai-BSD-3-Clause.txt and with the packaged ENGINEAI assets.

The RIMKit-local serial-links XML contains retargeting landmarks. Exact
provenance, modifications, and hashes are recorded beside the packaged model.

## Asimov-1 robot description

Model: Asimov-1

Source: https://github.com/menloresearch/asimov-1

Pinned source revision: b8420ffe99159065152aa1321a03147c0962f251

Licenses: GPL-2.0-only for the simulation model and CERN-OHL-S-2.0 for the
hardware-derived mesh assets. Copies are provided as
`licenses/asimov-GPL-2.0-only.txt` and
`licenses/asimov-CERN-OHL-S-2.0.txt`, and beside the packaged assets.

The RIMKit-local MJCF removes the standalone scene, cameras, and physics
options, makes mesh paths include-safe, and adds hip, sole, and toe
retargeting landmarks. Exact provenance and hashes are recorded beside the
packaged model.

## AgiBot X2-Ultra robot description

Model: X2-Ultra (X2 Ultra new version)

Source: https://github.com/AgibotTech/agibot_x2_urdf

Pinned source revision: 77f43eb0904dae4c48ccd9154fee824f8ffd4d38

License: MulanPSL-2.0. A copy is provided at
`licenses/agibot-MulanPSL-2.0.txt` and with the packaged AgiBot assets.

The RIMKit-local MJCF removes the model-local timestep and tracking light and
adds sole, toe, hand, and hand-tip retargeting landmarks. Exact provenance and
hashes are recorded beside the packaged model.

## Kimodo generation provenance

Example motion files: the eight `.npz` examples under
examples/motions/kimodo/soma_rp_v11/.

Generator repository: https://github.com/nv-tlabs/kimodo

Generator code license: Apache-2.0

Generation model: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1.1

Model license: NVIDIA Open Model License

RIMKit includes generated `.npz` output only. It does not include Kimodo code,
model weights, or a model checkpoint. The model license states that output is
not a Derivative Model and that NVIDIA claims no ownership in output. The
motion files are licensed by Taemoon Jeong under CC BY 4.0. See
examples/LICENSE.md and examples/motions/kimodo/SOURCE.yaml.

## GEM-X generation provenance

Example motion files: the eight `.pt` examples under examples/motions/gem-x/.

Generator repository: https://github.com/NVlabs/GEM-X

Generator code license: Apache-2.0

Generation model: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GEM-X

Model license: NVIDIA Open Model License

The CoRe authors generated the bundled pose estimates from original footage
recorded by the authors. RIMKit includes neither that footage nor GEM-X code,
model weights, or checkpoints. The motion files are licensed by Taemoon Jeong
under CC BY 4.0. See examples/LICENSE.md and
examples/motions/gem-x/SOURCE.yaml.

## SOMA77 fixed bind rig

GEM-X `.pt` inputs contain SOMA body parameters rather than evaluated joints.
RIMKit therefore includes a compact bind-rig asset derived from Kimodo's
`somaskel77/skin_standard.npz`. Only joint names, parent connections, and bind
transforms are retained; mesh and skinning data are excluded.

Source: https://github.com/nv-tlabs/kimodo

License: Apache-2.0. Exact source/local hashes and the derivation are recorded
in `src/rimkit/assets/soma/SOURCE.yaml`.
